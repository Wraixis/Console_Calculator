# Calculator Program

This is a simple calculator program written in Python. The program performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers provided by the user. The program continues to run in a loop until the user decides to exit.

## Usage

1. **Enter the first number**: You will be prompted to enter the first number.
2. **Enter the operator**: You will be prompted to enter an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). 
3. **Enter the second number**: You will be prompted to enter the second number.
4. **See the result**: The program will output the result of the operation.
5. **Repeat**: The program will continue to ask for numbers and operators until you enter `false` as the operator.

## Example

```plaintext
Enter 1-number: 10
Enter operator: +
Enter 2-number: 5
10 + 5 = 15

Enter 1-number: 20
Enter operator: /
Enter 2-number: 4
20 / 4 = 5.0

Enter 1-number: 8
Enter operator: *
Enter 2-number: 7
8 * 7 = 56

Enter 1-number: 9
Enter operator: false
